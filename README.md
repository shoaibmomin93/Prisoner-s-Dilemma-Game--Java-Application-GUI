# Prisoner-s-Dilemma-Game--Java-Application-GUI
Game theory is a field of study that attempts to formalize games and investigate rational decision making. One of the classic examples of games studied is the “Prisoner's Dilemma". The user will first select an opposing “computer strategy”. Once the game begins, the user will play 5 rounds for one “match” against the computer with the strategy chosen. The user can cooperate or betray in each round. The computer can cooperate or betray in each round as well and then we reach an outcome for that round. At the end of the game, a final score will be printed for the 5 rounds and the user will be prompted if they would like to play again. Lowest total years penalty is the winner of the 5 round game.
